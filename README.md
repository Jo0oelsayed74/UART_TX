This repository contains Verilog code for implementing a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) Transmit (TX) block. 
UART is a widely used serial communication protocol in embedded systems for transmitting data between devices asynchronously. 
This Verilog implementation provides a robust and efficient solution for integrating UART TX functionality into FPGA or ASIC designs.
